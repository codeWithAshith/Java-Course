List
----
- In List which is created using List.of(), we cannot add items to a list
- Other types of list are Arraylist, Vector and linkedList
- Arraylist is of  array data structure, so accessing data is faster
  but adding and removing data is slower
- Linked list if of double linked data structure, so accessing data is slower but
  adding and removing is faster
- Vector is also of array data structure, thread safe whereas arraylist is not thread safe

Set
---
- Set doesn't allow duplicate
- In Set which is created using Set.of(), we cannot add items to a Set
- Other types of Set are HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet
- HashSet uses Hashing table, data is not stored sorted but in a random order
- LinkedHashSet uses linked data structure, data stored is not sorted order
  but stored in the order which we inserted
- TresSet uses Tree data structure, data is sorted order

Map
---
- Used to store Key Value pair
- HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap
- HashTable is threadsafe and doesnot allow null value
