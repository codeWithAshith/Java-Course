Garbage collection
It in Java is the automated process of deleting code that's no longer needed or used

Mark
The mark phase is just a Depth First Search traversal on one root node and the idea is to
mark every node as LIVE that is reachable from the root node. Once all the nodes are marked,
we can conclude that the nodes that remain unmarked are garbage; and the ones to be cleaned up.

Sweep
The nodes left unmarked are the garbage and hence in the sweep phase,
the GC iterates through all the objects and frees the unmarked objects,
and resets the marked object to prepare them for the next cycle.

Java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects

Stack Memory in Java is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread.
It contains primitive values that are specific to a method and references to objects
referred from the method that are in a heap.
